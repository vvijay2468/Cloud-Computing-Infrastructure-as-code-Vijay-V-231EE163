## Deployment

To deploy this project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory where your `.tf` (Terraform) files are located.

2. Run the following commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

- `terraform init`: This command initializes your working directory with the necessary plugins and providers specified in your configuration files. It downloads the required provider binaries.

- `terraform plan`: It creates an execution plan, showing what changes Terraform will apply to achieve the desired infrastructure state. This step allows you to verify the changes before applying them.

- `terraform apply`: This command executes the actions proposed in the `terraform plan`, creating or modifying resources in your infrastructure based on the `.tf` files.
